In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, personalized learning approaches are the way to go, especially for children with learning difficulties. Traditional educational methods often fall short in addressing the diverse needs of such learners, leading to disengagement and limited progress. With advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning, particularly in transformer-based models, there is an opportunity to create intelligent systems that can better understand and respond to a child's unique emotional and behavioral cues.
ALP (Adaptive Learning Path) is an adaptive educational platform that uses transformer-based models to analyze facial expressions and gameplay behaviors of children with learning difficulties. This system will dynamically adapt the learning path of the child following challenges and feedback based on the detected emotional states promoting sustained engagement and improved learning outcomes.
While the system adjusts the learning path in real-time, it will always prioritize and adhere to the therapist s recommended path, ensuring that the adaptive process remains aligned with professional therapeutic goals.
